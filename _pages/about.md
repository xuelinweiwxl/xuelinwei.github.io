Hi! I'm currently a PhD student at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn) in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kui Ren]() and [Prof. Zhibo Wang](). Previously, I received my BS/MS in [SCIE](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn) at [UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn), where I worked with [Prof. Chang Wu]().

My research interests are in Trustworthy AI and Data privacy Preserving. In particular, I want to dedicate my career to developing more reliable and secure AI-based tools and enhancing the capability of AI systems.
